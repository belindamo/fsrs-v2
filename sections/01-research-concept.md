# Research Concept & Direction

Research Problem & Objectives:
Investigating the application of psychometric analysis to educational datasets through computational methods. The main question is whether existing educational data can be transformed into meaningful psychometric insights using modern data cleaning and analysis techniques.

Knowledge Gap:
Limited exploration of how GitHub-hosted educational datasets can be systematically converted into psychometrically valid research instruments and analyses.

Research Goals:
Clean and structure educational datasets for psychometric analysis
Develop reproducible workflows for educational data transformation
Validate psychometric properties of derived instruments

Scope: Focus on specific GitHub repository dataset provided by education professor

Expected Contributions: Novel methodology for educational data psychometrics, reproducible analysis pipeline
