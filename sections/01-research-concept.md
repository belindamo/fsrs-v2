# Research Concept & Direction

Research Problem & Objectives:
Advancing spaced repetition learning algorithms beyond current FSRS (Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler) implementations. Core questions include: How can we create more effective human-algorithm interfaces for spaced repetition? How can LLMs evaluate response quality organically? How do concept relationships affect learning efficiency?
Knowledge Gap:
Current spaced repetition systems lack sophisticated concept relationship modeling and LLM-integrated response evaluation. Limited research on conversational learning interfaces with adaptive scheduling.
Research Goals:

Develop improved scheduling algorithms using historical learning data
Integrate LLMs for organic response quality assessment
Model concept relationships through directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)
Create conversational teacher-student interaction frameworks

Scope: Building on SM2, FSRS foundations with novel LLM integration and graph-based concept modeling
Expected Contributions: Next-generation adaptive learning systems, concept relationship modeling methodology
